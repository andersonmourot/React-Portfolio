          My name is Anderson Mourot and I am from Little Rock, Arkansas. I recently completed the SMU Fullstack Coding Bootcamp to learn the
          front-end and back-end skills needed to find a job I am passionate
          about. In my free time I enjoy going to concerts, basketball with friends, and skiing. I also
          enjoy traveling around the world and seeing new cities and cultures. This is my portfolio where you can view
          examples of the apps I have created, as well as contact me for
          more information. Thank you for visiting!
